# Analyzing and Minimizing Loan Investment Risks using Random Forest Classifier
Banking and finance are the backbones of the world economy. The size of a particular country's banking sector shows how big that country's GDP might be.
Most legal transactions happen through the banking system, and there is a need to ensure the security of funds in financial institutions to build trust.
Banks make the majority of their money by lending out the investors' money to the people who need it for buying a house, car, personal reasons, etc., for a specific interest rate. These banks will face a loss if the borrowers donâ€™t return the borrowed money.

- In this project, we look at different factors that could be considered before giving out a loan to ensure that the loan is only sanctioned to people who can repay it.

- This analysis utilizes the Random Forest Classifier to minimize loan investment risks by analyzing the Lending Club loan defaulters dataset. 

- The study develops a predictive model that identifies potential defaulters and improves decision-making accuracy. 

- Hence, it emphasizes the need for the model to be used as a supportive tool and calls for further research and refinement for real-world lending scenarios.
